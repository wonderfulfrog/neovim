# wonderfulfrog's Neovim configuration

Uses [lazy.nvim][lazynvim] to manage plugins.

It's opinionated. You might not like it.

## Who is this geared for?

I'm a web developer, so this setup is configured for that environment. Anyone who works with React (and Native), JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, HTML, etc.

I've also added some plugins for writing in Markdown as I prefer it.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo into Neovim's config folder.
2. Run Neovim.
3. Wait for everything to install.
